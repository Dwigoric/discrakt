A simple app that acts as a bridge between [Discord](https://discord.com/) and [Trakt](https://trakt.tv) (and maybe even [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)), allowing for the display of the watch status as [Discord's Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence). Essentially, it's a Trakt/Plex Discord Rich Presence.

**Protip**: If you are already using Plex, and would like to link it with Trakt, you can use the [Plex-Trakt-Scrobbler](https://github.com/trakt/Plex-Trakt-Scrobbler) plugin.

If you already know **Trakt** and how awesome it is this is definitely the best option, as it works **more reliably** and with some extra benefits over the other implementations, such as registering your watch status **wherever you are watching** (TV, phone, across the world, etc.), **in whatever app you are watching on** (Netflix, Roku, Plex, HBO Max), as long as you have a single device running **Discord** and **Discrakt**.

Plex Rich Presence alternatives:

- [discord-rich-presence-plex](https://github.com/Phineas05/discord-rich-presence-plex)
- [plex-rich-presence](https://github.com/Ombrelin/plex-rich-presence)

## Setup

1. Create an API Application on [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new) (with scrobble capabilities and `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` as the redirect uri)
2. Edit the `config.ini` file with the required Trakt username.
3. Fill in the `client_id` and `client_secret` fields with the values from the API Application you created in step 1.
4. Run the respective executable, and you're ready to start sharing your progress!

*P.S.* Discord needs to be running on the machine Discrakt is running on.
*P.P.S.* Place the `config.ini` file in the same directory as the executable.

*P.P.P.S.* If you want to store the configuration in a common location, the `config.ini` can also be stored in:

|Operating System|Location| Example                                                      |
|--------|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|Linux|`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/discrakt or `$HOME`/.config/discrakt| /home/alice/.config/discrakt/config.ini                      |
|macOS|`$HOME`/Library/Application Support/discrakt| /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/discrakt/config.ini |
|Windows|`%APPDATA%`\discrakt| C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\discrakt\config.ini           |

## Running executables

Running the executables is as easy as clicking the provided executables in the latest [release](https://github.com/afonsojramos/discrakt/releases). That's it!

Optionally, after you ensure that everything is running correctly, you can also set the executable to run on startup, so that you don't have to run it manually every time you want to start sharing your watch status.

### Linux/MacOS

Create a script that runs the executable silently and set it to run on startup in [Unix](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/15475/run-bash-script-on-startup)/[MacOS](https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html).

```bash
#!/bin/sh
nohup ./discrakt > /dev/null &
```

### Windows

You can now use the silent Windows executable, and now you only need to follow [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd) to run it on startup.
  
#### Scoop

You can install Discrakt in [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) via the [Extras](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras) bucket:
```powershell
scoop bucket add extras # Ensure bucket is added first
scoop install discrakt
```

## Development

Make sure you've installed Rust. You can install Rust and its package manager, `cargo` by following the instructions on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
After installing the requirements below, simply run `cargo run`.
